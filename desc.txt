Green SME CoPilot — Agentic AI for Agenthathon
============================================

Purpose
-------
Green SME CoPilot is an agentic AI prototype built for Agenthathon to help small and medium enterprises (SMEs)
adopt sustainable practices. It demonstrates autonomous task orchestration, context-aware recommendations,
and human-in-the-loop governance for energy, waste, and supply-chain optimizations.

Key Capabilities
----------------
- Autonomous task planning: break down high-level sustainability goals into actionable tasks.
- Multi-step execution: chain tools and APIs to collect data, analyze, and propose interventions.
- Explainability: produce human-readable rationales and step logs for auditability.
- Safety & governance: human approval gates, rate limits, and reversible actions.
- Integrations: hooks for telemetry, ERP, energy meters, Google Sheets, and public sustainability APIs.

Architecture Overview
---------------------
- Orchestrator: agent planner that sequences skills and sub-agents.
- Skills: modular actions (data fetchers, analyzers, recommenders, reporters).
- Tools: external connectors (APIs, databases, sheet/backends).
- Policy Layer: safety rules, approval workflows, and audit logging.
- UI/CLI: minimal control surface for operators to review and approve actions.

Getting Started (dev)
---------------------
1. Clone the project and open in dev container (Ubuntu 24.04).
2. Install dependencies described in project README (Python/Node tooling as applicable).
3. Configure .env with API keys and test endpoints.
4. Start the orchestrator in dev mode, attach a mock toolset, and run sample scenarios.
5. Use human-approval endpoint to step through agent actions.

Safety & Ethics
--------------
- Designed for human oversight: every impactful action requires explicit operator approval.
- Rate-limited and permission-scoped integrations to avoid unsafe operations.
- Logs and explanations stored for audit and compliance reviews.

Contribution
------------
- Keep skills small and single-purpose.
- Write unit tests for each skill and integration.
- Document data sources and assumptions for every recommendation.

License & Contact
-----------------
- Default: MIT (adjust as needed).
